NSSL
====

NSSL is Not Secure Sockets Layer. It is in fact a stupid school project about basic encryption.

It's also under the GPL v3 for some reason. Deal with it.

ToDo
----
- Needs class...as in, classes. You know? How you make stuff in C++
- Add choice to terminate or continue
- Add choice to decrypt or encrypt
