NSSL
====

NSSL is Not Secure Sockets Layer. It is in fact an awesome school project about
basic encryption made by incredibly cool students.

It's also under the GPL v3 license because it is important to license things.

Ideas
----
- Random number generation option for key
- ROT13 optional extra layer of encryption

Requirements
----
- Needs to use classes
- Option: encrypt or decrypt
- Program flow: continue or terminate

Check this "Chat" part, possibly we will use this library:
