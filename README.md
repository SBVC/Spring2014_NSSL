NSSL
====

NSSL is Not Secure Sockets Layer. It is in fact an awesome school project about
basic encryption made by incredibly cool students.

It's also under the GPL v3 license because it is important to license things.

Known Bugs
----------
- When entering text to be encrypted, the prompt will display twice the first
  time.
- When asking for a filename to load from, the program will act like you've
  tried to load "" and errors, then prompts again.

Ideas
----
- ROT13 optional extra layer of encryption
